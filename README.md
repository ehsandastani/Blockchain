# Blockchain

First, we should know this is just a data structure like the others! I mean it is not a separate layer in the network that we have to merge them!<br>:pinched_fingers:
<p style="text-align: justify;">
With blockchain technology, we can create an environment in which nodes that do not trust one another can share data they can trust. The idea is based on several concepts that are simple to consider but difficult to put into practice. First, data is logically presented as a ledger. The data isn't really stored that way; you can just think of it as a ledger.

Note that:
* A ledger is a way of recording data as transactions occur.
* You can only add data to a ledger. You cannot change anything after you've added it. So, the only two operations you can perform on this ledger are <b>"add"</b> and <b>"read"</b>.
* Data is added to this ledger in blocks. blocks are collections of transactions, each with an owner's address.
* Addresses are the unique IDs of accounts in our ledger system.
* When there are enough transactions to make a new block, some of the blockchain participants begin the process of adding a new block to the ledger.
* Each new block is linked to the previous block, making a chain.
