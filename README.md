# Blockchain

First, we should know this is just a data structure like the others! I mean it is not a separate layer in the network that we have to merge them!<br>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
With blockchain technology, we can create an environment in which nodes that do not trust one another can share data they can trust. The idea is based on several concepts that are simple to consider but difficult to put into practice. First, data is logically presented as a ledger. The data isn't really stored that way; you can just think of it as a ledger.

Note that:
* A ledger is a way of recording data as transactions occur.
* You can only add data to a ledger. You cannot change anything after you've added it. So, the only two operations you can perform on this ledger are <b>add</b> and <b>read</b>.
